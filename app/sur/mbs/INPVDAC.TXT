INPUT TO SUBROUTINE PPBZC1.FOR
SUBROUTINE PPBZC1(IGEO,GEO,NI,ND)
THE INTERNAL FORMAT CONSISTS OF AN INTEGER ARRAY 'IGEO'
AND A REAL ARRAY 'GEO'. THE INTEGER DATA IS AS FOLLOWS:
C... INTEGER DATA
C 
IGEO(1)=ORDER OF THE CURVE
THE REAL ARRAY 'GEO' SHOULD CONTAIN THE EXPLICIT POLYNOMIAL
COEFFICIENTS ACCORDING TO THE VDA-FS FORMAT, I.E IN ORDER THE X-COEFFS THEN
THE Y-COEFFS AND THEN THE Z-COEFFS OF THE CURVE. THE CURVE SHOULD BE
A [0,1] CURVE SEGMENT.
THE ARRAY SIZES OF IGEO, GEO ON OUTPUT ARE RESPECTIVELY
NI=1
ND=IGEO(1)*3
