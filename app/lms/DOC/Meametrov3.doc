 Read point data and optionally deviations from a METRONOR file and 
 draw points in a 2D view (Saab view XY, XZ, YZ or ISO).

 Format of the Metronor file: d , b or d (reduced)

 There is a parameter which optionally offset the points with
 respect to the surface normals of the measured surface points.
 The outside of an aicraft wing is defined mathematically (as
 the reference surface) but measurements may for instance be done
 on the inside tool surface for a wing panel. In this case can
 the offset parameter be used (offset= wing panel thickness).



 The module reads data from a Metronor file with measured points.

 Each point is registered as a part with the name MEAPOIREC. The
 attributes (parameters) to this module (object) hold all data
 about the point. Attributes are:
 VECTOR       m_p;                ! Measured point
 VECTOR       r_p;                ! Reference point 
 FLOAT        d_tot;              ! Total (perpend.) deviation to surface
                                  ! (distance beween m_p and r_p)
 INT          p_no;               ! Point number
 INT          g_no;               ! Subset number
 STRING       descr*132           ! Name and description of the point  

 The module is of type DRAWING (2D), since the module is used
 (called) in the VARKON MEASURE application which is a 2D
 application. Diagrams and drawings are output (but many 
 calculations are of cource in 3D, i.e. called modules are
 of type GEOMETRY).
 
 Input to this module is a view, i.e. a part which defines
 the transformation and scaling of the points for the 
 drawings. There is a module (object) figvyv2 which creates
 one of four standard Saab drawing views (with the Z axis
 pointing downwards).

 The Metronor file cannot be used directly. Some manual 
 editing is needed (a new module is planned ...)

 Comment lines must be erased and between each subset of points
 must two lines be added:
     1.234567  1.234567  1.234567
    1.234567  1.234567  1.234567

 The file must end with the following two lines:
    -1.234567  -1.234567  -1.234567
    -1.234567  -1.234567  -1.234567

 Free comments may be written after these two lines.


 It is for the wing profile analysis assumed that a subset
 of points are points from the upper or lower part of the 
 wing.

 An edited Metronor file can be created by the simulation
 module meapsim1v1

 This part is input to the modules which creates measurement
 analysis diagrams. The graphical representation of the points
 (as points or curves interpolating the subsets of points) makes
 it possible for the user to select this part interactively .
