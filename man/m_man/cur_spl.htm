cur_spline -<font size=+0> Geometric procedure</font></h2>
Creates a curve
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Description</b>
<p>Creates a non rational cubic parametric segmented curve that interpolates
two or more positions and optional tangents. Tangents not specified are
calculated using one of the following spline algorithms.
<p>Ferguson: This algorithm gives a curve with C2 continuity and very gentle
curvature variation. It is best suited to interpolate evenly spaced positions.
Use this curve if you want a curvature variation which is as gentle as
possible.
<p>Chordlengt: This curve is also C2 continous but curvature can change
rapidly. Positions may be unevenly spaced and you will still get a nice
curve but with very unevenly spaced positions the curve might produce a
loop. Use this curve if you want a curve which is equal to the loftmans
traditional wooden spline.
<p>Variable Stiffness: This curve is only C1 countinous. The algorithm
is based on a model where each segment of the curve has a bending stiffness
proportional to the distance between its two end positions.&nbsp; Short
distance between positions gives a softer segment that may have higer curvature
than a longer segment which becomes stiffer.Use the variable stiffness
curve if you have very unevenly spaced positions and want to be sure to
get a nice curve with no loops.
<p>For each position an optional tangent position may be specified. If
supplied, tangent positions should be given as true positions relative
to the corresponding position the curve interpolates (not relative to (0,0,0))
and with appropriate length. A tangent position of (0,0,0) is treated as
"no tangent". A long tangent gives a wawier segment and a short tangent
gives a less wawy segment.
<p>If no tangents are given in the start- and/or end position the result
will be a curve with a free end(s), ie. with curvature = 0.

<p><b>Examples</b>
<p>cur_spline(#10,"CHORD",vec(0,0), ,vec(5,5), ,vec(10,0));
<p>Creates a planar curve with two segments. All tangents are automatically
calculated (splined) by the system using the chordlength spline algorithm.
<p>cur_spline(#1,"STIFFNESS",vec(0,0,0),vec(0,10,0), vec(5,5,0),vec(10,0,10),
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
vec(10,0,0),vec(0,-10,0), vec(15,0,0),vec(0,10,0));
<p>Creates a twisted space curve with three segments. Tangent positions
are supplied for all defining positions. The tangent for the first position
is 10 units long and has the same direction as the positive Y-axis. Since
tangents are given for all defining positions the curve is completely defined
in advance and no internal splining is needed. In that case "STIFFNESS"
will produce the same result as "FERGUSON" or "CHORD".
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>Comments</b>
<p>The spline type "FRRE" and "PROJ" used in Varkon version 1.17A and earlier
are still supported but removed from the documentation and should not be
used any more.
<p>cur_spline is intended for curves with relatively few defining positions,
maximum = 50. To interpolate large number of positions use <a href="cur_spla.htm">cur_splarr.</a></blockquote>
